{% img profile_photo basic-alignment left /images/about-me/avatar_blu_smal.jpg Łukasz Żuchowski %} My name is Łukasz Żuchowskki. I’m a software engineer that solves customer problems with a handful of Java, Scala or Groovy code and pinch of frameworks. During my career I have been working for international companies within distributed teams on various types of applications from domain registries to financial services. I have en experience with a variety of web frameworks, application servers, databases and tools. I’m constantly improving my skills by learning new languages, technologies and frameworks.

My job experience is complemented with Java community activity. Thanks to the community I’ve not only had opportunities to learn new technologies on Warsaw Java User Group meetings but as well participate in organization of Confitura conference. I was one of the founders of Scalar Conference.

I’m a fan of Agile methodologies and practices. Open-minded, eager to learn and self-improve.
