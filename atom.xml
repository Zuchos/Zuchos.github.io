    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I started using <em>akka-http</em> and what I was trying to achieve was to receive data from request, send response that the data were received successfully and then process it asynchronously. The other requirement was that the processing flow could be complicated in the future and some parts of it could be faster than other, so I decided to use <em>akka-streams</em> for that. I started with empty <em>akka-http</em> service:</p>

<p>What is now missing is the Publisher that will publish data that came from http request into the akka-stream. To do that we need to define <code>DataPublisher</code>. It will be an implementation of <code>ActorPublisher</code> trait. It will be receiving data and then it will be publishing those to the next element in the flow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like this time of the year. Summers just begins, it&rsquo;s nice and warm outside the sun is shining and my favorite community conference takes place. Confitura is very close to my heart. I had a pleasure to participate in the organization in the past. But this year I was on the other side, a speaker. I was a bit curious how community will react on the topic of my speech (&ldquo;How to be a happy Developer?&rdquo;)? Would it catch attention and fill the room? It was a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; presentation after all.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>But my doubts vanished in the air of full venue and were definitely gone afterwards when the applause rang out. Thank you for attending to my presentation, it was a pleasure to share my insights about carrier with you. For those who chose the other session, no worries, you will still be able to watch it. Just wait a bit and follow ConfituraPL on Twitter or Facebook (the video should be available on youtube).</p>

<p>One of the insight on my presentation was that &ldquo;the most important are the people around you&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the thing that I love about Confitura. Each year I have a great opportunity to meet lot&rsquo;s of people. Those that I met during studies, my past jobs, community leaders and conference veterans. It&rsquo;s like family reunion. I haven&rsquo;t seen many of those guys for a long time and sometimes we haven’t heard from each other for a while, but during Confitura we talk together, gossip or joke like it was yesterday. Besides that I met lot&rsquo;s of new people too, I hope we will see each other next year (or maybe during WarsJava?).</p>

<p>Kudos for organizers and volunteers, job well done. That was great developers family reunion!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not so long time a go, I was on the conference about Agile (<a href="http://agilebyexample.com/">AgileByExample</a> - great conference by the way) and one of the sponsors has a win-tablet contest. To win brand new Nexus you had to post on their facebook wall answer for a question:</p>

<blockquote><p>What does Agile mean to you?</p></blockquote>

<p>I posted 2 answers but the contest was setup and someone else won my Nexus (just kidding of course). Conference was over but the question was coming back, ringing in my head. What the hell is Agile ? Is it methodology (ugly word), nickname for <strong>Scrum</strong>, <strong>XP</strong> or maybe just a <strong>buzzword</strong>? Other questions emerged: Who could be <strong>agile</strong>? Developer? Analyst? CEO? Housewife? My confusion was rising… I knew that I had to start from the beginning. What is called Agile by most of the people? For sure one of those:</p>

<ul>
<li>TDD</li>
<li>Scrum</li>

<h4>What are the similarities?</h4>

<p>TDD gives me flexibility to change my code anytime and I know that it will work as I&rsquo;m expecting. Scrum (same as Kanban) helps me to deal with changing (or just discovered) customer&rsquo;s requirements. Main difference between agile approach and its opposite: <strong>waterfall</strong> (or simply planned end-to-end process) is ability to handle <strong>change</strong>. So simply agile means <strong>being adaptive</strong>.
 Adaptation is very important thing, in fact it&rsquo;s a matter of live or dead.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change. <cite>Charls Darvin</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>So if you don&rsquo;t want to end up like mammoth or dinosaurs, be adaptive! I think that the reason why nowadays start-ups and small innovative companies are so successful. They are adaptive!</p>

<h4>Adaptive: another buzzword?</h4>

<p>But not to get from one buzzword to another, what is my definition of being adaptive. I believe that there is a philosophy behind it. I come to terms with fact that I&rsquo;m not able to plan and control everything (believe me, that it took me a while). Maybe for some of you it&rsquo;s obvious, but I&rsquo;m programmer. When I write println(&ldquo;hello world&rdquo;), the text is printed out. Moreover in the real world I am expected to make promises and fulfill them (those are named estimates, plans, sprint backlogs etc). So sometimes I may have illusion that I&rsquo;m in control. That means that: I may think long enough and come up with solution or plan that will work! And will always work… cause it&rsquo;s smart and made well.</p>

<h4>And here comes Agile…</h4>

<p>There is no a such thing as perfect plan, solution or even estimate. Some things are better than the other, but usually you don&rsquo;t know how good they are until you try. The solution is to start with something small, try it out and then change. Repeat that cycle forever (I call it: try-change cycle). There is always temptation to spend more time on planning and invent a perfect solution. But in my opinion it&rsquo;s better to spend that time on trying out. The other problem is that, in big organizations to change something you must have well-documented-bullet-proof plan and blessings from the CEO or managers. That&rsquo;s the reason why such organizations are almost incapable to change. So if you are working in such organization remember: it&rsquo;s much better to change one team (call it pilot project) immediately than spend a year to make a plan that will change organization. If your team will be successful it would be much easier to spread the change. On the other hand, if your first solution will fail you may easily change it (remember, be adaptive!).</p>

<h4>Agile is direction not destination</h4>

<p>Bottom line is, be adaptive, prefer try-change cycle over thinking on master plan. Always start with something small, try it out (as it is) and then if it doesn&rsquo;t work well enough, change it. Remember! You are never <em>there</em>, something that may work today but tomorrow world will change. You should never-ever end try-change cycle. That&rsquo;s my definition of agile and anyone could be agile: student, developer, programer, CEO, housewife, literally anybody. I tried to be agile in my personal life and no surprise here, it works!</p>

<h4>Beware</h4>

<p>Beware you will meet salesmen that will tell you that there is a magic pill called Scrum or whatever. You just buy it or make a certificate and you are agile! Just like that! If you believe them, it means that you are not agile enough. I don&rsquo;t say that making certificates or training doesn&rsquo;t make sense, just remember that those are just tools to become agile, not the agile itself.</p>

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

<p>Everything you just read it&rsquo;s my personal option. I&rsquo;m not considering myself as agile guru or coach. I just think that I understood what agile means to me and I want to share this though with you. Thanks for reading that, if you disagree or have some more insights about agile just leave a comment or drop an email.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In SML we do code reviews. We do them on daily basis. Actually the point that we are now is a result of long journey that we made. We try different strategies and tools until we went to the place that we are now (but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we are going to end up here).&lt;</p>

<p>During this journey we found many risks and traps that are waiting for a newcomer. That&rsquo;s what this post is all about, traps &amp; misconceptions on code review.</p>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://zuchos.github.io/images/posts/2013/puppet.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Code control:</strong> many organizations uses CR for controlling codebase. Most of them are using pre-commit strategy. In many cases its because those projects are open-source with hundred of commiters. In real life this is quite rare scenario, so if you hired someone it means that you trust him enough to let him commit code to repository. I know that in some organizations there will be temptation to make procedure that will force developers to &ldquo;review&rdquo; and &ldquo;approve&rdquo; every commit, but it will not guarantee the quality. Moreover people will soon treat code review as &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; corporate procedure and will try to hack-it (such changing password every month e.g. people are using passwords like: mypass1, mypass2 etc.).</p>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://zuchos.github.io/images/posts/2013/Codebrag.png">
<strong>Hall of blame:</strong> Don&rsquo;t user CR for finding scape goats or guilty ones. Let&rsquo;s assume that there was a failure and you found a person who &ldquo;reviewed&rdquo; the &ldquo;bad code&rdquo; and blame him for not pointing it out. I will cause that development in your company will drastically slow down. People will be pointing out every semicolon not at the right place, because they will be afraid of being scape goat. Your team members will start feeling unconfident and the lack of trust.</p>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://zuchos.github.io/images/posts/2013/duty.jpg">
<strong>&ldquo;Code&rdquo; of duty:</strong> Don&rsquo;t push on your developers to much. If you force them to make review every day for an hour, soon they will hate it and treat as unfunny duty. Code review is about learning, praising others and giving feedback so it&rsquo;s very social activity. CR could be fun, don&rsquo;t spoil it.</p>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://zuchos.github.io/images/posts/2013/wolfs.jpg">
<strong>I&rsquo;m not my code:</strong> If your code was reviewed by someone and he left some comment (sometimes even not too nice), don&rsquo;t get angry. He isn&rsquo;t saying that you are a poor developer. That wasn&rsquo;t his intention nor code review is about that. All he did, was criticizing some piece of code (not the author). Code review is all about code, not about you. Don&rsquo;t treat code review tool as forum with &ldquo;trolls&rdquo; and people fighting each other. When you will be writing comments try not to be rude or too strict. Try to imagine that your are on the other side reading it.</p>

<p>To sum it up, there is plenty of ways to make code review wrong. Those 4 are the one that I experienced or anticipated, so beware. I promise to write post about &ldquo;what code review is about&rdquo;.</p>
